For example add existing user rocky to wheel group
# usermod -G wheel rocky

Now open /etc/pam.d/su PAM config file:
# vi /etc/pam.d/su

Append line as follows:
auth required /lib/security/pam_wheel.so use_uid

OR
auth required pam_wheel.so use_uid

Save and close the file.

Because of above setting only members of the administrative group wheel can use the su command. However I still recommend sudo over su for better control, security and ease of use. This is also default behavior on FreeBSD.
