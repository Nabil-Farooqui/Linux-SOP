    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6
    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5
    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4
    rsh-server

// installing from cd
# mount -t iso9660 /dev/sr0 /media

# cd /media/Packages
# rpm -ivh rsh-server-*.rpm

and 

# yum -y install rsh rsh-server

# systemctl restart rsh.socket
# systemctl restart rlogin.socket
# systemctl restart rexec.socket

# systemctl enable rsh.socket
# systemctl enable rlogin.socket
# systemctl enable rexec.socket

Note:
Remote execution is controled by two files.
--1. /etc/rhosts.equiv (All users except root)
--2. $HOME/.rhosts (target server)

The first column is the name of remote machines from which logins are allowed.

The second column is the name of the user who will be running rsh. If this is blank the username on the target is used.

Each of the two fields can be set to + to indicate a wildcard.

For example, to allow the user ram on the machine client.itzgeek.com to log in as raj on the target, add the line on target machine.

Next Step
# vim /home/<username>

abc.xyz.com	<username>		#Remote server and user_name

wq!			save and exit

--now run the command
# rsh -l <username> abc.xyz.com uptime

Note:Ensure TCP Port 513/514 are open on the remote server to accept connections
